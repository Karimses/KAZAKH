AKT_aktau.1.d:0 "Gaziz remembers his country, he remembers when he was in Kazakhstan, happy, but now his country is divided by bandits and monsters, he hates Russians for that, destroying his country.  After he and his clique managed to take over the city of Aktau, Gaziz wanted one thing, to create a pure Kazakhstan, without bandits, slavs and traitors, but his warlord is weak compared to other warlords and he needs to reform this city and its army to realize his dream."

AKT_aktau.2.t:0 "The Speech"
AKT_aktau.2.d:0 ""Fathers and mothers of Kazakhstan! Toilers of the great Turkic race! Descendants of Asena, the wolf-mother! Today you all came here to see the beginning of a great cause, the birth of the renewed Kazakh nation that awoke from its long dream! For centuries, our proud and mighty people have been oppressed and humiliated by the Russian barbarians. The unscrupulous Khans, as well as Tsarist and Soviet sycophants, everyone who sought their petty goals and acted against the interests of their nation, traded our freedoms to the conquerors from Moscow and those few brave individuals who refused to recognize the Slavic sovereignty were ruthlessly destroyed. Not satisfied with merely subjugating our people and robbing of our earned wealth, the Russians were eager to put us in a slavish position and divide our race into opposing clans, shattering our national unity for their enrichment on our sorrows.\n\nEven after the Muscovite empire fell under the mighty strike of the German state, they never stopped to terrorize our families and never abandoned their hope to destroy our nation. On the verge of this bitter infighting of a Kazakh against Kazakh and attempts of Russians to restore their heinous rule, we ask you to overcome your mutual hatred, sowed by our most despicable enemies, and unite towards one purpose - the supremacy of the Kazakh people in their own lands, our shared dream that is impossible to achieve as long as a Russian is allowed to spread their evil in Kazakhstan. Our country faces the times of the greatest challenges, and even if the few of you would allow your weaknesses to take over your will, our glorious mission will meet its tragic end.\n\nMay here the providence of gods give us the courage and perseverance to us, the people who fight for the freedom and greatness of our race.""
